    summary: "Understanding the two primary legal systems in the world and how they affect your rights.",
    content: `COMMON LAW vs CIVIL LAW SYSTEMS

There are two (2) types of legal systems in the world:
1. Civil Code
2. Common Law

The basis of our legal system in the U.S. is English Common Law. Each state in the U.S., except Louisiana, has Common Law for the basis of its legal system.

TYPES OF COMMON LAW:
1. Common Law of England
2. Common Law of Several States
...expressed either by Statute or Court Decisions or both.

KEY DIFFERENCES:

COMMON LAW:
- Derived from custom and usage over a period of time
- Generally accepted by the people through written and reported court decisions
- You can do anything EXCEPT what the law forbids
- Statutes should be nothing more than written declarations of common law

CIVIL LAW:
- Derived from declarations of the persons in power
- You cannot do anything EXCEPT what the law authorizes

This fundamental distinction is critical for understanding your rights as a PMA member. Under Common Law, you have inherent rights that exist unless specifically prohibited, whereas under Civil Law, you only have rights that are explicitly granted.`,

    title: "The 14th Amendment & Equal Protection",
    summary: "How the 14th Amendment protects your constitutional rights against state action.",
    content: `THE 14TH AMENDMENT & EQUAL PROTECTION

The controlling legal principle: The command of the Fourteenth Amendment is that no 'State' shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.

STATE ACTION DOCTRINE:
'A State acts by its legislative, its executive, or its judicial authorities. It can act in no other way.'

The constitutional provision means that NO agency of the State, or of the officers or agents by whom its powers are exerted, shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.

KEY PRINCIPLE:
'Whoever, by virtue of public position under a State government, denies or takes away the equal protection of the laws, violates the constitutional inhibition; and as he acts in the name and for the State, and is clothed with the State's power, his act is that of the State.'
- Ex parte Virginia, 100 U.S. 339, 347

THE SUPREMACY CLAUSE (Article VI):
The Constitution is the 'supreme Law of the Land.'

Chief Justice Marshall in Marbury v. Madison (1803):
'It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.'

This decision established that the federal judiciary is supreme in the exposition of the law of the Constitution - a permanent and indispensable feature of our constitutional system.

BINDING EFFECT:
Art. VI makes constitutional interpretations of binding effect on the States 'any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.'

Every state legislator, executive, and judicial officer is solemnly committed by oath (Art. VI, ¶3) 'to support this Constitution.'`,

    content: `U.S. v. CALDWELL - 989 F.2d 1056 (9th Cir. 1993)

This important case addresses the limits of government power to prosecute citizens for "obstructing" the government.

KEY HOLDING:
The court stated it cannot "lightly infer that in enacting 18 U.S.C. § 371 Congress meant to forbid all things that obstruct the government, or require citizens to do all those things that could make the government's job easier."

CRITICAL PRINCIPLE:
"So long as they don't act dishonestly or deceitfully" - citizens are not required to make the government's job easier.

IMPLICATIONS FOR PMA MEMBERS:
1. Private agreements between members are protected
2. Government cannot criminalize private conduct simply because it doesn't assist their enforcement
3. Honest, non-deceptive private transactions remain protected
4. The burden is on government to prove dishonesty or deceit

This case reinforces the Common Law principle that citizens can do anything except what the law specifically forbids, rather than needing permission for every action.`,
