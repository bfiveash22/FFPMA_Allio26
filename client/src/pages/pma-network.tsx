    details:
      "The $10.00 membership fee is mandatory, non-negotiable, and serves as the legal gatekeeper for the entire PMA structure. This fee creates a private contractual relationship between the member and the association. Without this paid membership, there is no private domain, no contractual standing, and no legal protection. Every single person who enters the PMA must pay this fee — no exceptions, no waivers, no deferrals. The $10.00 is what transforms a public interaction into a private, constitutionally protected agreement.",

    title: "Everyone Signs — No Exceptions",
    details:
      "Every person within the clinic walls must be a signed, dues-paying member of the PMA. This includes the doctor, staff, patients, visitors, vendors — anyone who steps foot inside the private domain. If they are not signed and paid, they are not protected and they compromise the entire PMA structure. There are zero exceptions to this rule. The moment an unsigned person is present, the private domain is breached and legal exposure is created for everyone.",

    title: "Member Contracts Must Follow the FFPMA Standard",
    details:
      "All member contracts must follow the Forgotten Formula PMA standard format. This includes: a Declaration of Purpose, a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), a reference to the Mother PMA (Forgotten Formula PMA), the $10.00 membership fee clearly stated, a HIPAA waiver and privacy acknowledgment, a Private Domain Declaration, and proper signature blocks for both the member and an authorized officer. No freelancing, no custom contracts, no shortcuts.",

    title: "Constitutional Authority — Not State Regulatory Jurisdiction",
    details:
      "The PMA operates under constitutional authority — specifically the 1st Amendment (freedom of association) and the 14th Amendment (due process and equal protection). The Association operates strictly within the private domain and does not concede that public regulations, statutes, or licensing requirements governing the delivery of services in the public domain apply to private association activities. The constitutional foundation is what gives the PMA its power — and that power is only maintained when every rule in this list is followed without exception.",

    details:
      "Each Affiliated Clinic Association files IRS Form 8832 (Entity Classification Election) independently to elect to be taxed as a corporation. The clinic files Form 1120 annually at the 21% corporate tax rate. This keeps each clinic's tax filing separate and independent — no parent entity is listed on Form 8832. The constitutional affiliation with the Mother PMA is established through the Network Membership Agreement and governing documents, not through the tax filing.",

Missing any one of these documents means the PMA is incomplete and potentially unprotected.",

      "Each Affiliated Clinic Association (Child PMA) operates as a voluntary constitutional affiliate of the Forgotten Formula PMA. While each affiliate maintains its own independent governance, officers, and day-to-day operations, it must operate within the framework established by the Mother PMA. This means following all 8 rules, using approved templates, maintaining proper records, and ensuring all members are properly enrolled. Autonomy exists within the structure — not outside of it.",

      "The Articles of Association, contract templates, and operational framework of the Forgotten Formula PMA are proprietary intellectual property. These documents are never to be shared outside the PMA network, posted publicly, given to attorneys not affiliated with the PMA, or used as templates for non-FF PMA organizations. Violation of this rule compromises the entire network and may result in removal from the PMA umbrella.",

                    The Forgotten Formula PMA is the founding Mother PMA — a Private Membership Association organized and operating within the private domain under the protections afforded by the 1st Amendment (freedom of association) and 14th Amendment (equal protection, liberty interests). All Affiliated Clinic Associations (Child PMAs) affiliate through voluntary constitutional affiliation as separate legal entities — not subsidiaries, franchisees, or state-created entities. The Mother PMA provides the constitutional framework; clinics exercise their constitutional right to associate.
